# DSL

Darwin subsytem for Linux. Not actually a subsystem like WSL, but runs an Ubuntu 16 VM on [xhyve](https://github.com/machyve/xhyve) and adds a nice frontend to manage the VM.
Goal is to make running Ubuntu or any flavour of linux as seamless as possible using existing technologies.

## Licensing

We do not own the Ubuntu image - the hosted base image is derived from Ubuntu Server 16.04.5 and Canonical Ltd. is the rightful owner of Ubuntu. Please open an issue if this needs a proper licensing.
